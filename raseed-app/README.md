# Raseed App - Flutter Chat Application with Gemini AI

## Project Overview
Raseed is a Flutter application that provides a chat interface powered by Google's Gemini AI models. The app integrates with Firebase for backend services and allows users to query about their receipt/bill history stored in the system.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (version 3.8.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK
- Firebase account
- Google Cloud project with Gemini API enabled

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gokul-a-krishnan/raseed-app.git
   cd raseed-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project
   - Add Android and Web apps to your Firebase project
   - Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in `android/app/`
   - Configure Firebase Web in `index.html`

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Firebase Configuration
The app uses Firebase for:
- Authentication
- Cloud Firestore (for storing receipt data)
- Firebase AI (for Gemini integration)

Configuration is handled in `lib/firebase_options.dart` which is auto-generated by FlutterFire CLI.

## Application Architecture

### Main Components
- `main.dart`: Entry point with app initialization and main widget
- `firebase_options.dart`: Firebase configuration
- `pages/`: Contains various screens
  - `chat_screen.dart`: Main chat interface
  - `receipts.dart`: Receipt history view
  - `add_receipt.dart`: Add new receipt
- `widgets/`: Reusable UI components
- `server/backend.dart`: Handles API calls and data operations
- `data/bill.dart`: Data model for receipts

### Flow
1. App initializes Firebase
2. User lands on ChatScreen
3. System loads receipt history in background
4. User can:
   - Chat with Gemini about receipts
   - View receipt history
   - Add new receipts
   - Switch between Gemini models

## Key Features
- Chat interface with Gemini AI
- Multiple Gemini model support (1.5-flash, 2.5-flash, 1.5-pro)
- Receipt history integration
- Easy model switching via dropdown
- Loading indicators with flutter_easyloading

## Dependencies
Key dependencies (see pubspec.yaml for full list):
- `firebase_core`: Firebase integration
- `firebase_ai`: Gemini AI access
- `provider`: State management
- `flutter_easyloading`: Loading indicators
- `dio`: HTTP client

## Usage Examples

### Chatting with Gemini
1. Type your query in the chat input
2. Press send or hit enter
3. Gemini will respond with information based on your receipt history

### Switching Models
1. Click the dropdown in the app bar
2. Select desired Gemini model
3. Continue chatting - responses will use the selected model

### Viewing Receipts
1. Open the drawer menu
2. Select "Receipts"
3. Browse your receipt history

## Troubleshooting
- If Firebase fails to initialize, verify your `google-services.json` is correctly placed
- For Gemini errors, ensure your Google Cloud project has Gemini API enabled
- For receipt loading issues, check your internet connection
