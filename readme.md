# Raseed Project Overview

This repository contains two main components: a Flutter-based mobile application and a Flask-based backend system.

## Raseed App (Flutter)
The `raseed-app` directory contains the Flutter chat application. This application provides a chat interface powered by Google's Gemini AI models, allowing users to query their receipt/bill history stored in the system.

For detailed information, setup instructions, and usage guides, please refer to the dedicated README:

## Raseed Backend (Flask)
The `raseed-backend` directory contains the Flask backend application. This system is responsible for processing receipts and invoices, featuring a REST API for receipt management, intelligent invoice processing using Google's Gemini AI, and an email listener for automatic invoice processing from PDF attachments.
